; Transmit silence while a channel is in a waiting state, a recording only
; state, or when DTMF is being generated. Note that the silence internally is
; generated in raw signed linear format. This means that it must be transcoded
; into the native format of the channel before it can be sent to the device.
; It is for this reason that this is optional, as it may result in requiring a
; temporary codec translation path for a channel that may not otherwise require
; one.
